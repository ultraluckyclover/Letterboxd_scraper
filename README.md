# Letterboxd_scraper
Program that takes your Letterboxd watchlist url and returns a random selection using Selenium. I utilize
web scraping as a technique for acquiring data from any input Letterboxed watchlist.

I made this in a notebook in order to eliminate the need for the user to download a Chrome version-specific webdriver.
Since there is a pip install at the beginning of the program, anybody can open this and use it in their google colab, as long as 
it is in Google Chrome.
